# **💡Project Idea**
The idea behind this project is to be able to create Task Manager that helps you track of all the tasks that you need to complete. 
# **How to Setup and Run**
Make sure all files are in the same directory.  

Have two terminals ready - one for the server and one for the client - and cd into the project's directory in each.  

## **To Compile**
In the server terminal, run the following command:  
```
javac TaskServer.java
```
In the client terminal, run the following command:  
```
javac MainWindow.java
```

## **To Run**
In the server terminal, run the following command:  
```
Java TaskServer
```

In the client terminal, run the following command:  
```
Java MainWindow
```

Finally, interact with the GUI on the client side!
